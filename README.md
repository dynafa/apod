Golang NASA APOD Web App

A simple golang web application which consumes data from the [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and uses Golang HTML templates and structs with server-side rendering to present the data within an HTML template. Added the JS front-end logic to support navigation using the arrow keys and a date query parameter to easily request historial APOD entries.
